# Cookie Cheat

A set of tools for optimizing your play of "Cookie Cutter"
from Orteil.

## ConjureCalc: Checks optimal cookies saved for conjuring.

### Example:

'''
1. import conjureCalc in Python REPL (I use IPython)
    [you could also run ipython -i conjureCalc.py]

2. conjureCalc(x) will return the number of cookies that you should
    keep for optimal "Conjure Baked Goods" use.
    x is your current Cookies Per Second (CPS).
    (Note that if you have Shorten Numbers on, use the "Shortened 
    Number" and this will return a "Shortened Number" too.)

3. Spend cookies but keep above the optimal level.
