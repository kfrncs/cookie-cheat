# Cookie Cheat

A set of tools for optimizing your play of "Cookie Cutter"
from Orteil. Requires pyautogui

## conjure_calc: Checks optimal cookies saved for conjuring.
## autoclick: clicks like crazy til you move your mouse to the top left corner of the screen.
### Example:

'''
1. Use conjure_calc(x) will return the number of cookies that you should
keep for optimal "Conjure Baked Goods" use.
x is your current Cookies Per Second (CPS).
(Note that if you have Shorten Numbers on, use the "Shortened 
Number" and this will return a "Shortened Number" too.)

2. Cast the Conjure Cookies spell when you're above the optimal cookie level. Use autoclick()
when you're not.
